Thank You for the Opportunity. 

1. I have completed the test it might have some minor bugs due to time constraint.
2. I tried to match fonts and all size specs as much as i can 
3. Assumption was not to be used in mobile even though i tried as much as i can to make it work in the smaller screens.
4. Used "Digital Colour Meter" to pick colours.


All the screenshots provided was to show how it functions, you can check it.

With cors issue used proxyurl to bypass that and you can use local json in main.js
